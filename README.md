## About this Project

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is my favorite way of working and staying productive. So the thought of building and designing my own Pomodoro timer using the skills and knowledge I've accumulated so far with my previous projects sounded incredibly fun. And this is that project, which I've appropriately named 'Tomodoro'. I relied on a lot of DOM maniplulation for this one, and quite a few functions relied on each other. But everything works as intended, and I had a very fun time on this JS project.
